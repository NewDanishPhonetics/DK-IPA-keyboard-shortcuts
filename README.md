# DK-IPA-keyboard-shortcuts
An AHK script for typing IPA characters with a standard DK keyboard

Mark a word in your text editor and convert the characters to IPA using the replacement table in the script. E.g. rå_:p9 is converted to ʁɔ̰ːpɐ.

The replacement table utilizes æøå on a standard DK keyboard, and uses the most convenient shortcuts for IPA characters commonly used for Danish. The script can easily be altered to include other shortcuts.

# How to use

1. Install AHK https://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Download and run the DKkeyboardToIPA.ahk script
3. Press the hotkey (default: ALT+z) to convert selected text
